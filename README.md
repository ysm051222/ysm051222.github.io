Hi there! My name is Seungmin Yoo [sʰɯŋ.min.ju]

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in [linguistics at Seoul National University](https://linguist.snu.ac.kr/en/). 

I'm currently deeply interested in 
- [Syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax)
- [Formal semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_semantics_(natural_language)) (I love [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) notation so much!)
- [Phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology)
- [Corpus linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_linguistics)
- [Graphematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphemics)

As my understanding of linguistics is still developing, I'm currently exploring a wide range of topics within the field. 

## Language
Basically, I'm a non-lingual.

- Intermediate level - Korean

- Elementary level - English, Arabic, Japanese, Chinese

I am currently studying Arabic, Manchu and Japanese! I think their scripts are super cool.

## Hometown
I am from Gongneung-dong, Nowon-gu, Seoul city, Republic of Korea.
If you want to visit me, feel free to come here.
